### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * It is difficult to test certain features since we need many players at the same time and cerain specific conditions 
 * It is difficult to develop the layout of the Elfenland game screen since we canâ€™t see the screen without getting enough players to join.
 * Creating a test class to view the game screen independently of the lobby is also challenging because it depends so much on the game state and players present.


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * We should have considered the GameScreen superclass at the beginning of development. It is more difficult to separate the Elfenland and Elfengold GameScreen subclasses now since everything is implemented for Elfenland only.
