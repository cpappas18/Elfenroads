### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * It might be impossible to avoid new users having to open a web browser to create an ngrok account 
 * We had set up our code so that the GameScreen and GameState classes depended on each other, which created a lot of problems when choosing which one to initialize first in the GameManager class.  
 * It is harder than anticipated to hinglight an object when your cursor is on it, does not seem worth it considering tine


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * We should have developed the GameManager before the GameState and GameScreen classesâ€¦ it would have saved a lot of refactoring time. The lesson here is that we should plan first, implement second
 * We should have built the skeleton of the game (what holds the game together) before, instead of trying to connect the differnet game componenents
 * We should be careful with TouchCORE collaboration in order to avoid conflicts
