### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Nick assumed that a P2P connection would be easy enough to implement, but varied router settings of each user are making it difficult 
 * Boots are difficult to click and donâ€™t always move on the first try  
 * We need to find a way to make an executable file instead of running from java class
 * **


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Even home networks are highly secure by default
 * We should not have hardcoded the locations of all of the panels on the GameScreen and the towns and roads on the map - it makes it a lot more tedious to change the values when things are resized. Relative measurements would have saved a lot of time
 * The UI is difficult to modify since it is highly dpendent on other structures, so next time we should try to make a more modifiable UI
