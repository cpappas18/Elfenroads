### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * *Time management because of assignments and exams in other courses*
 * *Deciding if the non-determinacy of Elfenroads (shuffling the deck, for example) can be supported by a peer-to-peer architecture*
 * *Difficult to apply peer-to-peer architecture to environment model*


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * *Chloe brought up a good point about the the issue of randomization in a peer-to-peer architecture*
 * *Working on the operation model gives us a better grasp on how to eventually ideas into code*
 * *It is useful to have some degree of networking knowledge for domain modelling of Elfenroads* 

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

* *We haven't added the networking code yet, so nothing in that department*
* *UI is still using the boppel instead of a boot (that was on purpose, but a workaround to a bug where the boot appeared rotated)*
