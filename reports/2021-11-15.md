 * *Hard to find small easy examples on internet to help understand better*


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * *Networking is not an easy subject and will requires lot of work*
 * *The protocol model is a great way to get a quick overview of the sequence of allowable actions in a board game*
 * *Communication diagram helps to get a better and clearer idea of the game’s structure considering interactions* 

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

* *We focus on modelling this week and have not done more coding of UI and networking, so there is no bug so far.*

### Contribution statement

 * *Yijia Jing contributed 16% of the work effectuated since last week.*
