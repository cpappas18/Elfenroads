### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Saving a game requires putting it in a serializable form but can't find a way to make load 
 * Counters sometimes cannot be selected on the screen, reason unknown
 * Apple's Java libraries for interacting with ApplicationEvents, available on Maven, (like pressing CMD-Q) are really outdated and did not work


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * We are using an exploratory testing approach since it is more likely to find major bugs
 * The Command pattern we are using for networking makes it really, really easy to add minor network features (such as chat)
 * 


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)
* *UI issues with counters*
