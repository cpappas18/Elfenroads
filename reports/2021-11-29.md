 * **


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * *When doing requirements specification for software in a real work environment, collaboration and ongoing feedback on every model is the best way to ensure consistency and accuracy*
 * *Because some models are developed based on other models, we should plan the order to work on models in order to improve efficiency.*
