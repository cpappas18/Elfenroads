### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report
 * *Huasen missed displaying the counters on the scoreboard*
 * *Charles, Philippe, Nick, Yijia and Chloe did not miss anything*
 


### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Java swing sometimes displays strangely on PC. We havenâ€™t figured out why
 * Counters sometimes cannot be selected on the screen, reason unknown
 * We need to enforce an ordering on incoming commands at game start-up or else things may be initialized in the wrong order


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * We are using an exploratory testing approach since it is more likely to find major bugs
 * The ocde logic is often good, the problem often lies with the network or UI
 * Java swing is probably not the best choice for making video games


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)
* *UI issues with counters*
* *Some bugs seem to appear only when playin with 3 or more players. 2 players is fine*
