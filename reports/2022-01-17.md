### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Chloe tried to implement dragging functionality on the ElfBoots (in addition to clicking) but this was much more difficult than she had anticipated. Overlapping JPanels make it difficult to redraw the ElfBoot as the mouse is dragging it. Currently looking into these bugs. 
 * We initially stored the in-game information in the GameScreen class. However when we consider the case when a player wants to leave the current game and load a different game, we found that we shall separate the GameState and GameScreen so that we can initialize a GameScreen with GameState every time a Player joins a game
 * Multithreading with different networks
 * **


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Dynamic, responsive interfaces are difficult to build using Java, a language designed for the back-end. The movement of sprites on the screen is more intuitive using JS or Swift.
 * We are meeting during the Thurday lecture, easier for everyone
 * We will start using github isuues if we want to change large pieces of code and avoid conflicts
