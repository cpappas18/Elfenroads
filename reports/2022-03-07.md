### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Organizing and delegating tasks for late-stage game development
 * We need to connect to the samel local network in order to play the game together. So none of us except Nick can test the game in a multiplayer setting because we only have one machine.
 * Testing the game is hard since we need multiple machines


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * We should have used GitHub issues more. It helps us efficiently assign tasks.
 * We are focusing on the essentials for the demo
 * We are using an exploratory testing approach since it is more likely to find major bugs


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)
* *Connection exception when joining game*
